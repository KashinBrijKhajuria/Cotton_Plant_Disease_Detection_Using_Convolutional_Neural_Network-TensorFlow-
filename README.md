# Cotton Plant Disease Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network

Model was developed through **transfer learning** using **ResNet 152V2** from
Keras Applications . Model was trained in **GoogleCollaboratory** using
TensorFlow-GPU . **A Flask application** was built around the model in which
users can provide an image of a cotton plant or leaf , which the model
classifies as a healthy cotton plant / leaf or diseased cotton plant / leaf ,
displayed on the web page .
